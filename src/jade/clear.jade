        | CLEAR is the fastest and easiest way to get through airport security. They approached Makeable asking for a communication solution to eloquently express their services in order to bring in new users. We created a Wordpress site for them and I did the front-end and designed a few of the elements. The site features an interactive map using the Google Maps API, parallax scrolling, and unique interactive features.

       p Instead of trying to add colors to Makeable's palette which is against brand guidelines, I designed with the idea of themes for each page. Specifically, each page in a category like team or projects would have a different gradient and duotone theme.
