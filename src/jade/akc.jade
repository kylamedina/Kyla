          p American Kennel Club approached Makeable with a series of projects that included an overhaul of their website, several apps with desktop experiences, and promotional sites for the apps. I have been involved in all of the projects in different capacities.
          p One of the projects that I was heavily involved in is Wooftale&mdash;lovingly deemed 'Facebook for Dogs'. I worked on the front-end of the Cordova / Angular app as well as the desktop experience and the promotional site. The promotional site uses Expression Engine but will be migrated to Angular when the desktop experience is finished. 
          p Another project I worked on was AKC Marketplace, an offshoot of the main site that allows vets, groomers, dog walkers, boards, breeders, and pet shops to create their own page to promote themselves to the AKC community. I did the design, matching the system created for the main site. After the main pages were created as PSDs. I moved to designing in the browser and lead front-end development.
