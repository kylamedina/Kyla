              p I've played many roles at Makeable. Designer, Developer, Photographer, even UXer and a part of the strategy team once or twice. It's a reflection of my love for the internet and digital culture.
              p For over two and half years, I've been taking photos of Makeable that are used in company assets. I also recently had the honor of redesigning Makeable's website and which is currently ongoing. I've created a couple different directions so far and below are some highlights. This page is kind of a work in progress as I will update it as the project progresses from design through development. Interspersed are some of the photos I've taken for Makeable.

            p In this iteration, my primary objectives were to emphasize Makeable's process&mdash;Imagine, Make, and Grow&mdash;in an easily readable way with a grid system that breaks up the long descriptions that are written for each project. In the current site, the Imagine phase is not represented at all. I changed that by creating a hashtag that Makeable can use to pull in photos through Instagram's API.
            p During the Imagination phase, Makeable creates story maps that are essentially a creative exersize that creates a design direction for the project and is printed for clients. I wanted to mimick story maps for screens because they are a very important part of Makeable's process.

       p Instead of trying to add colors to Makeable's palette which is against brand guidelines, I designed with the idea of themes for each page. Specifically, each page in a category like team or projects would have a different gradient and duotone theme.
